We wanted to investigate the correlation between the different aspects of National Risk Index score (ie. Expected Annual Loss and Social Vulnerabiltiy) and housing prices. We fitted linear regression and multiple linear regression models across our predictors to look at the relationship with housing prices. Once we finished our analysis, we found weak and moderation correlations between housing prices and the various components of the National Risk Index score. We also took into account other confounding variables, such as climate and personal income per capita, and found that climate had a weak negative correlation with housing prices while personal income per capita had a moderate positive correlation with housing prices.
