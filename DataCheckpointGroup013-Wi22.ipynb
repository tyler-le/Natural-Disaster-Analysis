    "**Table #1 (Frequency of Disaster By State):** This dataset was fairly clean in that there were no missing values and each observation contains whether or not a state had a natural disaster event in a certain year. We decided to remove spaces from the column names and to replace them with underscores. Since each column describing a natural disaster contains the count of how many natural disasters of that type, there was little data cleaning needed for this dataset.\n",

    "**Table #2 (Types of Disasters By State/County):** This dataset was fairly clean. We first focused on extracting the relevant columns, which were \"state\", \"declarationType\", \"incidentType\", \"declarationTitle\", and \"declarationArea\". These were the relevant variables since we want each state, the type of natural disaster, and whether it occured on a county level or not. We filtered the dataset to only contain natural disasters that occurred at the county level and standardized the column. We decided to keep the year it happened rather than the exact month and day since in our EDA in the future we would like to explore the natural disaster frequencies by decade. To make future analyses more convienient, we renamed some of the column names. Also, we checked for missing values and found that there were none. \n",

    "**Table #3 (National Risk Index):** This dataset was fairly clean. We focused on extracting the relevant columns, such as county, population size, National Risk Index score, and expected annual loss.

We also decided to lowercase all the columns and replace spaces with underscores for consistency across all dataframes.\n",

    "**Table #4 (States with Coastline):** This dataset was fairly clean. Originally, each observation in this dataset contained a state and its associated coast. If the state did not have a coast associated, it had a value \"None\". To aid with future analyses, such as fitting multiple linear regression models later on, we changed the \"coast\" column to be binary where 0 means that a state does not have a coast associated with it and 1 means that a state does have a coast associated with it.\n",
