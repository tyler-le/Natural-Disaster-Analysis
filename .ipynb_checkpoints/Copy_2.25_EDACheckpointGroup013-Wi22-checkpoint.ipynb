    "**Table #1 (Frequency of Disaster By State):** This dataset was fairly clean in that there were no missing values and each observation contains whether or not a state had a natural disaster event in a certain year. We decided to remove spaces from the column names and to replace them with underscores. Since each column describing a natural disaster contains the count of how many natural disasters of that type, there was little data cleaning needed for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table #2 (Types of Disasters By State/County):** This dataset was fairly clean. We first focused on extracting the relevant columns, which were \"state\", \"declarationType\", \"incidentType\", \"declarationTitle\", and \"declarationArea\". These were the relevant variables since we want each state, the type of natural disaster, and whether it occured on a county level or not. We filtered the dataset to only contain natural disasters that occurred at the county level and standardized the column. We decided to keep the year it happened rather than the exact month and day since in our EDA in the future we would like to explore the natural disaster frequencies by decade. To make future analyses more convienient, we renamed some of the column names. Also, we checked for missing values and found that there were none. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Table #3 (National Risk Index):** This dataset was fairly clean. We focused on extracting the relevant columns, such as county, population size, National Risk Index score, and expected annual loss. These variables are important because we would like to compare counties per capita. We also decided to lowercase all the columns and replace spaces with underscores for consistency across all dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table #4 (States with Coastline):** This dataset was fairly clean. Originally, each observation in this dataset contained a state and its associated coast. If the state did not have a coast associated, it had a value \"None\". To aid with future analyses, such as fitting multiple linear regression models later on, we changed the \"coast\" column to be binary where 0 means that a state does not have a coast associated with it and 1 means that a state does have a coast associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table #5 (Cost of Living by County and State):** This dataset was fairly clean. However, we wanted to look at cost of living as it relates to injuries, casualties, and private property damage broken up by county. Currently, the data we have only shows the cities. We used a geocoder to retrieve the county information. We then made a new column in the dataframe to store counties for each city and rearranged the columns to a favored format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table #6 (Average Climate by County)**\n",
    "This dataset was very clean. All that we needed to change was remove ID numbers after the state abbreviations and change the column names from \"Location ID\" to \"State\", \"Location\" to \"County\", and \"Value\" to \"Temperature (F)\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Table(s) #7 (Disaster datasets with fatalities, injuries, and property damage for each US State)**\n",
    "These datasets were not very clean. The variables of interest (state, fatalities, injuries, and property damage) were observations in the dataset instead of column names so we needed to drop those observations and rename the columns. We dropped rows with null values and changes columns to their correct data types. We created another column for the state abbreviation. Lastly, we dropped rows that are not US States.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table #8 (Cost of Living by State only)**\n",
    "This dataset was very clean since there are no null values and the data types are correct. All we had to do was rename columns and drop columns we did not need."

    "To address our second part of our research question (in which state does the impact of natural disasters affect cost of living the most in terms of injuries, casualities, and property damage?), we looked at the distributions of the cost of living index, fatalities, and injuries variables using boxplots. These distributions all appear right skewed towards higher cost of living, higher number of fatalities, and higher number of injuries. Each of these distributions have a few outliers that were identified after plotting the boxplots. To visualize the property damage variable distribution, we generated a histogram, which appears right skewed. A few outliers were identified afterwards. Note that we did not choose to use a boxplot for property damage because there is an extreme outlier that obscured the visualization of the IQR of the boxplot. When examining the outliers for the injuries, casualities, and property damage variables, California appeared in all of the outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we looked at the relationship between the cost of living index with injuries, casualities, and property damage by generating scatterplots and calculating correlation values of cost of living index with injuries, casualities, and property damage. The correlation values suggest that there are weak, negative correlations between cost of living with injuries, cost of loving with casualities, and cost of living with property damage."
